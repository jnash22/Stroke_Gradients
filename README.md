# README

This repository contains the code base with exemplar data to run the major analyses in the python environment. The main script is "Load_data_do_eccentricity.py" and can be found in "Python_code" directory. It requires the following packages: json, nibabel, nilearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, surfplot and brainspace to exectue.  All packages defined in the load libraries must be installed in order to run the code. The test data can be found in the "Sample Data" directory. All relevant atlases and surfaces can be found in "Atlas" directory. The example output of the code can be found in the "Figs" directory. The run time is about 5-15 minutes on MacOS Sonoma. Note: Some path names may need to changed locally.
